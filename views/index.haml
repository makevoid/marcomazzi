    This event-exhibition, taking place during one week in Sincresis Spazio d’arte in Empoli, Italy, will sketch out a potential exhibition on the (re)enactment of public memory in public space, fleeting or more stable forms of monumentality, and potential modes of reactivation in different types of media. On the cover of the book from which this event-exhibition borrows its title, Marco Mazzi suggests that “photography is the exact opposite of pure immediacy.” The process of photography’s infinite deceleration from the immediacy of the event until an immeasurable standstill, which is emphasized by the importance of publications in the exhibition space – hermetic structures compared to the openness of the painting –, is traced through a series of works that all engage in a certain rearrangement of history and memory present in Albanian public space.

    Curated by Vincent W.J. van Gerven Oei and Marco Mazzi.

    Exhibiting artists: Ag, Diego Cossentino, Vincent Van Gerven Oei, Adam Staley Groves, Pim van der Heiden, Armando Lulaj, Iva Lulashi, Marco Mazzi

    Odaiba (2013)

  :textile
    The Odaiba set of photographs opts for a constructivist view of social processes and models. It analyses the regression of the cultural memory and historical contingency of a place, dwelling on the crisis, which is facing the sharing and communication of knowledge in post-modern times. The images show a car park, a botanical garden, a shopping centre, the Toyota dealership and the beach of Odaiba. Natural and artificial elements are part of a social mechanism that encourages the aesthetic experience, provided that the latter is able to provide specific tools of analysis aimed at understanding the means of economic participation of the individual in existence.

    Odaiba is a large man-made island in Tokyo Bay. Odaiba was originally formed by a set of six fortresses, built in 1853 by the Tokugawa shogunate to protect the city of Tokyo against a possible attack from the sea. Over decades Odaiba has undergone a radical transformation. From its beginnings as a military site, it became a symbol of ultramodern life and an example of a late-capitalist urban area, especially as from the late Nineties. This set of photographs attempts to document the mechanisms that govern internally the construction of a new type of urban fabric, mainly commercial, global and consumeristic, which does not presuppose historical awareness as a dialectical structure of a culture.

    Relational Syntax (2012)

  :textile
    The book Relational Syntax is structured around a question: does a suitable aesthetics exist today for an art that could call itself “political”? The authors tackle the issue by surmising that the various mediums (linguistic, film, textual and video) allow for a theory of knowledge and analysis of ideas to be drawn up, which does not belong to the representation of an individual subjectivity, but to the community. Hence the interest in archive resources and in an aesthetic conscience that lets artists analyze and reconstruct a critical representation of the reality in which the forms recover their power to alienate, creating new margins of opposition and deduction.
